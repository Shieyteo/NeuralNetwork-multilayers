# NeuralNetwork-multilayers

## _Handwritten Digit Recognition written from scratch in C++._

- Training is done on mnist-number Dataset. On 28x28 Images
- Only for Windows, however simple to change to any operating system.
- Possible to test on drawn images in paint (dont resize image)
- Custom Images can be used (ppm,bmp) and CSV for Training
- TANH-Activation works best but Sigmoid also works.
- Atleast 400MB RAM for Training needed
